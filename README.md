This is an application developed by Victor Hugo Fernandes da Silva.

The application was developed in the Python programming language consuming an API of the Zabbix tool.

To access the application's main menu, simply execute the command 'python3 menu.py'.

With access to the menu, you can:
1. Create a new host;
2. Remove a host;
3. List all alerts;
4. Silence an alert;
5. List all unsilenced alerts;
6. Query host CPU and memory;
7. Exit the program.

To configure Zabbix, just edit the 'config.ini' file in the project root and add the following content:
server = 'Zabbix URL'
user = 'Zabbix user'
password = 'Zabbix password'

If you have any doubts, please contact the developer.
